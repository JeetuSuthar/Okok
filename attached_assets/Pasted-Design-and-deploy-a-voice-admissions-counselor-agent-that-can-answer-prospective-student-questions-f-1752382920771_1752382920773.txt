Design and deploy a voice admissions counselor agent that can answer prospective student questions for a generic university (no college names or addresses should appear in your agent’s responses). You may use any hosted agent platform—e.g., Bland AI, Vapi, LM Studio, or your own stack, so long as you can share a public link.
1. Agent capabilities
Greet callers, identify their intent, and gather basic details (name, course interest, preferred start date).
Provide accurate information on course name, duration, annual fee, and the fee after a 20 % scholarship using the data table below.
Handle follow‑up questions such as “Do you have any master’s programs?”, “What is the fee after scholarship for BBA?”, or “How long is the BH​M program?”.
Gracefully respond “I’m afraid I don’t have that information yet, but I can pass your query to our human counselor” for any out‑of‑scope questions.
2. Data your agent must reference (keep the exact wording for fees, durations, and scholarship figures; do not mention a college name, address, or website):

3. Deliverables (72 h turnaround)
Public link to the agent so we can interact with it (voice).
A brief README (≤1 page) covering: prompt stack / flow, tools used, how you stored & retrieved course data, and 2–3 edge cases you handled.
Email both the link and the README to kartik@samora.ai with the subject line “Prompt Engineering Task – <Your Name>”.

4. Evaluation
You will be evaluated on the number on the edge cases you can think of find the solutions to in the prompt
How natural the voice experience feels like? How you calibrate the llms to respond in a voice first manner
